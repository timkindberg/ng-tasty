  "readme": "#karma-coveralls ![dependencies](https://david-dm.org/caitp/karma-coveralls.svg)\n\nA Karma plugin to upload coverage reports to [coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/)\n\nBased on the work on [grunt-karma-coveralls](https://github.com/mattjmorrison/grunt-karma-coveralls),\nwith the primary difference being that this plugin does not depend on grunt, and simply exists as a\n[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) plugin.\n\n##Usage\n\nIn your karma configuration, ensure your list of reporters contains at the very least `coverage` and\n`coveralls`, for example:\n\n```js\n  reporters: ['coverage', 'coveralls']\n```\n\nFollowing this, ensure you are generating lcov reports from the coverage reporter, like so:\n\n```js\n  coverageReporter: {\n    type: 'lcov', // lcov or lcovonly are required for generating lcov.info files\n    dir: 'coverage/'\n  }\n```\n\nAnd finally, the coveralls reporter depends on some additional configuration, which may be set\nvia environment variables, karma config options (properties of the `coverallsReporter` object),\nor presence in the `.coveralls.yml` configuration file:\n\n```\n+-------------------------+------------------------+---------------------+\n| ENV VARIABLE            | YAML VARIABLE          | KARMA VARIABLE      |\n+-------------------------+------------------------+---------------------+\n| `COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN`  | `repo_token`           | `repoToken`         |\n+-------------------------+------------------------+---------------------+\n```\n\nPlease note that is is NOT recommended to save your repo token in plain text for everyone to see.\nTreat it like a password. If you need to include it in a public repo you should [encrypt it](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-configuration/#Secure-environment-variables).\n\nBe patiant when sending coverage information to coveralls, it can take upto 4 hours for things to \nstart showing up properly.\n\n##Contribution\n\nPlease send pull requests improving the usage and fixing bugs, improving documentation and providing\nbetter examples, or providing some testing, because these things are important.\n\n##License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Caitlin Potter & Contributors\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
